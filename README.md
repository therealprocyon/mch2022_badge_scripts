# mch2022_badge_scripts
misc scripts for the MCH2022 badge, since the hatchery isn't live yet, and these are basic apps, I put them here. Use them for inspiration.

most of the scripts are quick tests. I may upload them to the hatchery when ready.
However, they're still pretty basic as I'm trying the badge out. The badge isn't publicly released yet.
Not all scripts are equally tested
